# Schrödinger's Time-Independent Equation

This repository contains a program for solving Schrödinger’s time-independent equation (TISE) for various potentials, including the **finite well**, **harmonic potential**, and **Pöschl-Teller potential**.

## Features
- **Finite Well Potential**: A potential well of finite depth and width.
- **Harmonic Oscillator**: The quantum harmonic oscillator problem.
- **Pöschl-Teller Potential**: A hyperbolic potential well used in quantum mechanics.

The program uses numerical methods to compute and visualize the wave functions and energy eigenvalues for the different potentials.

## Potentials
### 1. Finite Well Potential
The finite square well is a model of a particle confined in a potential well with finite depth.

### 2. Harmonic Oscillator
The quantum harmonic oscillator describes particles under a harmonic restoring force.

### 3. Pöschl-Teller Potential
This potential is used to model particles in a hyperbolic well, and can describe systems like diatomic molecules.
